## Lets build Javascript from scratch

This projects focus on creating a tasks and directly moved to `to-do` section, once the task is done, we can move the task into different section. We are trying to create like ``www.trello.com``

Some developers like me is not really good in this language, it would be nice if we can share knowledge by creating an issue, create a feature and lets solve the problem. etc.. etc..

## Installation

To get started use and follow the command below.
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
Then open `127.0.0.1:8081` in the browser.
